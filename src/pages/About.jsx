      <p className="text-black dark:text-white">
        Hi, Iâ€™m Joe Winter, a passionate Software Engineer transitioning from a
        career in Civil Engineering. With a Master&apos;s degree in Civil
        Engineering and professional experience designing and analyzing
        structures, I developed a strong foundation in problem-solving, critical
        thinking, and teamwork.

      <p className="text-black dark:text-white">
        In 2024, I decided to follow my growing interest in technology and
        completed the rigorous Makers Academy bootcamp, where I honed my skills
        in full-stack development. Over 12 weeks, I gained hands-on experience
        with tools and technologies like JavaScript, React, Python, Kotlin,
        PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, as well as key development practices such as
        Test-Driven Development (TDD), pair programming, and agile workflows.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="text-black dark:text-white">
        At Makers, I discovered a love for creating software that brings people
        together. From building multiplayer games using Socket.IO to designing
        responsive and dynamic frontends with React and TailwindCSS, I enjoyed
        collaborating in teams to tackle complex challenges.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="text-black dark:text-white">
        As a former structural engineer, I bring a unique perspective to
        software development. My experience creating precise designs and
        enhancing workflows with custom tools has translated seamlessly into
        writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
